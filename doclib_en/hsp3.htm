<h2 id = "ABOUT_HSP"> What is HSP? </H2>
		<p>
<abbr title = "Hot Soup Processor"> HSP </abbr> is a scripting language system that anyone can easily use.
You can easily build applications such as game programs, screen savers, tools and practical software using images just by writing a text script.
		</p>
		<p>
HSP has the following features.
		</p>
		<ul>
<li> Get started right away in a free development environment </li>
<li> Easy-to-remember instruction set makes it easy for beginners to handle </li>
<li> The created program can be converted into an executable file and redistributed freely, and no license fee is required </li>
<li> Many functions such as 3D display and communication can be added by the extension plug-in module </li>
<li> We have many user assets and usage records for over 30 years </li>
<li> Equipped with detailed manual and reference help system </li>
<li> A wealth of books and materials as a purely domestic tool </li>
<li> Software created by the conversion function of HSP3Dish can be run on android, iOS, Linux, WEB browser (html5) </li>
<li> Includes libraries for hardware control such as USB-IO and Arduino </li>
<li> Interpreter operating specifications are released as open source </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
HSP can be used in various situations depending on your idea.
		</p>
		<ul>
<li> For creating games of various genres from visual novels to full-scale 3D shooting </li>
<li> For creating desktop accessories and screen savers </li>
<li> For instant tools such as screen layout trials and image data conversion </li>
<li> For media browsers such as program launchers, menus, CG collections, music collections, etc. </Li>
<li> Other full-scale applications can be developed </li>
		</ul>

<h2 id = "DOUSA_ENV"> Operating environment </h2>
		<p>
HSP3 can run the development environment on <b> Microsoft Windows, Linux / Raspberry Pi </b>.
For detailed installation and usage, refer to the manual for each platform.
		</p>
		<dl>
<dt> <a href="hsp3win.html"> HSP3 Windows Manual </a> </dt>
<dt> <a href="hsp3linux_pi.html"> HSP3 Linux / Raspberry Pi version manual </a> </dt>
		</dl>
		<p>
See the <a href="hspprog.htm"> programming manual </a> for HSP3 grammar and programming rules.
		</p>
		<p>
The only development environment that supports the full functionality of HSP3 is the Windows version. The Linux / Raspberry Pi version only supports the command line version and HSP3Dish. <br>
Source code created in these development environments can be run on <b> android, iOS, html5 (WebGL) </b>. (There are some restrictions for each platform)
For more information on multi-platform, see <a href="hsp3dish_prog.htm"> HSP3Dish Programming Manual </a>.

		<p>
Please check the official site <a href="https://hsp.tv/" target="_blank"> HSPTV! </a> for the announcement of the stable version and beta test version.
The latest beta version of Windows under development is also available on OneDrive at any time.
You can get the entire archive from "Download". <br>
The Windows version of the source code is mastered by the OpenHSP Subversion repository. The Linux / Raspberry Pi version will be updated from time to time in the github repository. <br>
The beta version is a test version for verifying new features and fixes. Please note that there is a possibility of unexpected problems.
If something goes wrong or the operation is not stable, it is recommended to revert to the previous version and use it.

<h2 id = "ROADMAP"> Future plans </h2>
		<p>
We will continue to develop HSP3 with the aim of creating an environment where ideas can be realized more easily and in a short time. <br>
From the many requests and bug reports, we would like to gradually incorporate the ones that can be implemented.
Future plans and future considerations are as follows.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>HSP3.6</dt>
			<dd>
			<p>
We will continue to update the updated version for the functions that could not be introduced in HSP3.51.
The functions that are being considered for introduction in the future are as follows. (It does not mean that it is done in this order.)
			</p>
			<dl>
<li> Renewal of packfile, review of encryption function
<li> Modification of HSP script editor and expansion of input / debug support
<li> Organize and expand module functions
<li> 32bit support and speedup of HSP drawing buffer
<li> Sharing code and materials using internet connection, community support
			</dl>
			</dd>
			<dt>HSP4</dt>
			<dd>
			<p>
HSP2 first appeared in 1997, and HSP3 eight years later, but I hope to be able to connect to the next generation as the times change.
The situation required for programming is also changing. While inheriting the convenience of HSP, I would like to announce a roadmap that is easy to use with some compatibility cut. <br>
Currently, we are considering full UTF-8, 64-bit support, automatic code analysis and learning function, VM renewal (llvm etc.), native compilation (JIT) and so on.

<h2 id = "EDUCATION"> Use for educational purposes </h2>
		<p>
Onion software is continuing activities to popularize it while proposing the use of IT basic education through HSP.
		</p>
		<p>
Please use it for elementary school, junior high school, high school classes, club activities, etc.
Of course, the HSP itself can be used free of charge, and the attached manuals, documents, etc.
You can freely quote, reorganize, and redistribute texts such as help data.
In addition, many reference books are on sale in Japan, and a lot of information is available even if you study by yourself.
		</p>
		<p>
Lectures have already been given in some computer classrooms, and even in the "IT Craftsmanship Project" supported by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry,
Education using HSP was practiced.
		</p>
		<p>
HSP is considered to have many advantages for beginners and beginners.
Beginners and beginners think that it is necessary to create an environment where they can enjoy learning more than anything else, and the pictures move and the sounds come out.
            We emphasize elements that allow you to continue learning without losing interest, such as reacting.

<h2 id = "MESSAGE"> From the author </h2>
		<p>
HSP is not particularly compatible with other languages ​​(although it is mostly BASIC),
Nor does it have a new language system.
		</p>
		<p>
The aim of HSP is an old-style personal computer system.
		</p>
		<p>
Older computers are overwhelmingly poorer in memory and CPU speed than current ones,
I turned it on and it was ready to use, and I could see the result immediately by typing RUN in BASIC.
I feel that such an easy and easy system is being lost in today's personal computers.
		</p>
		<p>
There are no advanced language specifications such as object-oriented here,
It's easy to write in the order you want.
And I think that is also one way for small-scale development and beginner programming learning.
		</p>
		<p>
HSP is by no means a versatile system. If you want to do more advanced things or large-scale development with an interpreter,
Languages ​​such as C #, Python, and Java are better suited.
I wish HSP could make a small turn for a little processing that does not need to use such a high-class language.
		</p>
		<p>
(Onitama)
