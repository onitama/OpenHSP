HSPCMP ver3.6                                       HSP : Hot Soup Processor  
HSP Extension DLL Reference copyright 1999-2020 (c) onion software
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

・ Introduction

This tool is used in HSP script editor etc. of Hot Soup Processor ver3 or later
A possible HSP code compiler.
The DLL version for Windows is provided as hspcmp3.dll.
(This DLL is used by script editors as well as features from HSP scripts.
It is also possible to call. When using as an extension plug-in for HSP
It must be located in the same directory as HSP3.EXE and HSED3.EXE. )

Hspcmp.exe (hspcmp for Linux) is available as a command line version.


-Call from the command line

From the command prompt (or shell), hspcmp.exe (hspcmp for Linux)
You can do it.

The format of the call is as follows.

	hspcmp [options] [filename]

Option list

-o ??? Specify the name of the output object file (.ax) in ???
-d Generate an object file containing debug information
-p do preprocess only
-c Compile in HSP2.55 compatibility mode
-i Load UTF-8 format script
-u Output string data in UTF-8 format
-w Set debug window display flag
-s Output string data file (strmap)
-e0, e1, r0, r1 Execute the object file
                                   (e0 and r0 display only the runtime name)
                                   (In the case of r, r1, with error code confirmation)
--syspath = ??? Specify the HSP system folder at runtime
--compath = ??? Specify the path of the common folder

HSP script from the command line by using the hspcmp tool
You can compile and execute it.

Example:
		hspcmp -d -oout.ax test1.hsp

Compiled test1.hsp and included debug information
Output the object file as out.ax.

Example:
		hspcmp -e test1.ax

Run the object file test1.ax at HSP runtime.


-Call from script

To call the DLL from an HSP script, add the following line to the beginning of the script
please do it.

	#include "hspcmp.as"

After that, instructions will be added to use the features of the HSP code compiler.


・ Instruction details

	hsc_ini "filename"

Initializes HSPCMP.DLL.
If you want to use the features of HSPCMP.DLL, you need to initialize it first.
The file specified by "filename" is to be compiled.
Specify the file name including the extension (it does not have to be as).

	hsc_refname "filename"

Specifies the source script file name displayed in the error message.
This is because, for example, the name "test.as" is temporarily renamed to "hsptmp".
Even when saving and compiling, the error message is a "test.as" file
It is for displaying that an error has occurred inside.
Change the source script file name from the file specified by hsc_ini
If you don't need it, you don't have to specify it.

	hsc_objname "filename"

Specify the output object file name.

	hsc_compath "pathname"

Specify the common directory searched by #include.
"pathname" must always be a string ending in "\\".
If hsc_compath is not specified, the EXE using hspcmp.dll
The "common" directory below is referenced.

	hsc_comp p1,p2,p3

Compile the source file with the HSP code compiler and object
Create a file.
Whether to output debug information to an object file with the parameter of p1
Can be specified. Error line if p1 is 0 or omitted
Debug information required for display etc. is not added to the object file.
If p1 is 1, debug information is added.
If p1 is 2, only preprocess processing is performed.
If p1 is 4, the character string data is converted to UTF-8 code and output.
If p1 is 8, the character string data file (strmap) used is output.
If p2 is 0, compile with the "__hsp30__" macro defined.
If p2 is 1, no macro is defined. This is the script editor
It is for passing the "Use HSP extension macro" flag to the compiler.
When the value of p2 is +4 (bit2), the executable file included in the source is automatically created.
Create a packfile based on the instructions (#pack, #epack, #packopt).
If p3 is non-zero, object a flag to display the debug window
Embed in a file.
In order to execute the hsc_comp instruction, be sure to initialize and file with the hsc_ini instruction.
Must be specified.
Also, if necessary, change the object file name output by hsc_objname.
Specify. (The output file name is specified by hdc_ini by default.
The extension of the file name will be ".ax")
If necessary, execute the hsc_refname instruction in advance.
Please. As a compilation procedure,

1. "hsc_ini"
↓
2. "hsc_refname" (optional)
↓
3. "hsc_objname" (optional)
↓
4. "hsc_comp"

It looks like.

	hsc_getmes p1

HSPCMP.DLL output an error etc. to the character string type variable specified by p1
Assign a message.

	hsc_clrmes

Clears all message data output by the compiler.

	hsc_ver

HSP code compiler version information in the system variable refstr
Returns as a string.

	hsc_bye

Performs the termination processing of the HSP code compiler.
This instruction is executed automatically and is not normally used.

	pack_ini "filename"

Initializes the PACKFILE manager.
When performing a PACKFILE operation (instruction starting with "pack_"), first
It needs to be initialized.
The target of the operation is the file specified by "filename".
Specify a file name without an extension.

	pack_view

Display the content list with the file specified by pack_ini as a DPM file
To do. Get the result of pack_view with the hsc_getmes instruction.

	pack_make p1,p2

p1 = 0 = for standard EXE files / 1 = for external DPM files
p2: Encryption key (0 = use standard key / others = encryption key)

Creates a DPM file with the file name specified in pack_ini.
In p1, you need to specify whether it is a standard EXE file or a DPM file for external reading.
Also, when creating a DPM file, you can set the encryption key with p2.
If you specify 0 for p2, a standard encrypted DPM file (2.61 compatible) is created.
If you specify a value other than 0 for p2, encryption using that value as the key is performed.
In this case, if the key with the same value must be specified by the chdpm instruction on the script side when reading DPM,
Please note that it will not be decrypted as a correct file.
The files to be included in the DPM file are in the current directory.
It will be the file specified by the text in "PACK FILE".

	pack_exe p1

p1 = 0 = standard / 1 = full screen mode / 2 = screen saver

Creates an EXE file with the file name specified in pack_ini.
3 modes with p1 (standard, full screen, screen saver)
Can be specified.
The files to be included in the EXE file are in the current directory.
It will be the file specified by the text in "PACK FILE".
Also, the HSP runtime file (hsprt) is in the appropriate directory
Must be placed.

	pack_opt p1,p2,p3

p1 = screen X size (0 or default = 640)
p2 = screen Y size (0 or default = 480)
p3 = Operation switch at startup

Options for creating an EXE file with the pack_exe command
Specify. Specify before executing the pack_exe command
is needed.
You can set a special startup operation by specifying the following values for the operation switch at startup specified by p3.

1 = Hide initial window
2 = No directory move

The operation switch can select the function at the same time by adding.
Specify 0 if no special operation is required.

	pack_rt "filename"

Referenced when creating an EXE file with the pack_exe instruction
Specify the full path name of the HSP runtime file (hsprt).
If the HSP runtime file is not in the current directory
Please specify.
(Example: pack_rt "c: \\ hsp \\ hsprt")

	pack_get "filename"

Stores the file name specified in pack_ini as a DPM file
Extract the file that has been created.
The file specified by "filename" is fetched and put in the current directory.
It will be saved.

	hsc3_getsym

Outputs the symbol name used by HSP to the message buffer of the compiler.
The output will be in the format "symbol name, sys [| var / func / macro] [| 1/2]".

	hsc3_messize val

The size of the entire message obtained by hsc_getmes is set to the variable specified by val.
Substitute.

	hsc3_make "path"

Automatically creates an executable file.
For "path", specify the full path where the HSP runtime library is located.
Create an executable file according to the packfile options.
Use hsc_comp to create a packfile with options.

	hsc3_getruntime val, "objfile"

Required by the object file specified by "objfile"
Gets the runtime file name in the variable specified by val.
The variable of val must be initialized as a string type.
If the runtime file name is empty (""), the default
Indicates that you are using the runtime (hsp3.exe).

	hsc3_run "string"

Treats the contents of "string" as a command line for runtime execution.
For "string", "runtime name" and "object file name"
Specify each "boot option" separated by a space
is needed.


揃important point

HSPCMP.DLL is a plug-in file that is used at the same time as HSP3.2 and above.
Even if you create an EXE file, put HSPCMP.DLL in the same directory as the EXE file.
It will not work unless it is placed in. Also, you cannot add DLLs to the packfile.

If you have any notices or comments about this version,
Please send it to the mail or the bulletin board of HSP.

Appendix: How to compile a script from HSP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a sample that calls HSPCMP.DLL from an HSP script.
The following works the same as "Compile + Execute" in the script editor.

	#include "hspcmp.as"

	;
Compile and run the HSP3 source script
	;
	sdim mesbuf,$10000
	sdim rtname,256

fname = "test1.as"; script file name
objname = "obj"; object file name
debug_mode = 0; debug window display flag

	hsc_ini fname
	hsc_objname objname
	hsc_comp 0,2,debug_mode
	res=stat:if res!=0 : dialog "ERROR" : goto *goerror

delete fname + ".i"; Delete intermediate files

	hsc3_getruntime rtname, objname
	if rtname="" : rtname="hsp3.exe"

	cmdexe = "\""+dir_exe+"\\"+rtname+"\" "+objname
	hsc3_run cmdexe

*goerror
	hsc_getmes mesbuf

	objmode 1
flg = 1; 0 = not editable / 1 = editable
	mesbox mesbuf,636,446,flg+4

	stop

Appendix: How to call HSP extension plug-in from C program
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes how to call HSPCMP.DLL from a C program.
Other extension plugins can be accessed in basically the same way.
The example list is used in Visual C ++.


・ Caller

The list below is where HSPCMP.DLL is linked to define the function.
I define and use a function of type DLLFUNC.
The argument is (int, int, int, int), but there are 4 different types
Any call parameter (size is 4 bytes) will do.
In the example below, each function starting with hsc_ can be used by calling dll_ini.
Now, you can release it by calling dll_bye. (Here, at the time of opening,
It is supposed to call hsc_bye)

/*
		DLL support routines
*/

typedef BOOL (CALLBACK *DLLFUNC)(int,int,int,int);

DLLFUNC hsc_ini;

-Compiling and executing files using HSPCMP.DLL

The following example is an example of compiling and executing a file.
See the instruction reference for more information on instructions that start with hsc_.
The general flow is to specify the source script in hsc_ini and then
Specify the object file output by hsc_objname.
The file is then compiled with hsc_comp.
If there is an error, retrieve the message data with hsc_getmes
can do.
If there are no errors, call the runtime to run it.
In the example below, the directory is not specified, but it is actually
The path including the directory where the runtime is located, the path of the source script, etc.
It is a good idea to specify the name including it.

	/*
			HSP compile support routines
	*/

char hsp_file [128]; // Source script file name
char objname [128]; // Object file name
char errbuf [32000]; // Error message storage area
char cfname [_MAX_PATH]; // Runtime file name
char execmd [2048]; // Execution string
	int a,i;

	//		Compile as file
	//
	strcat( hsp_file,"test.as" );
	strcat( objname,"test.ax" );
	hsc_ini( 0,(int)hsp_file, 0,0 );
	hsc_objname( 0,(int)objname, 0,0 );
	a=hsc_comp( 1,0,0,0 );
	if (a) {
hsc_getmes ((int) errbuf, 0,0,0); // get the error
	}

	//		execute HSP3 process
	//
	*cfname = 0;
hsc3_getruntime ((int) cfname, (int) objname, 0, 0); // Get the runtime
	if ( *cfname == 0 ) {
		wsprintf( execmd,"%s ", "hsp3.exe" );
	} else {
		wsprintf( execmd,"%s ", cfname );
	}

	strcat( execmd,objname );
	if (hsp_cmdopt[0]!=0) {
		strcat( execmd," " );
strcat (execmd, hsp_cmdopt); // If you have command line options
	}

	i = hsc3_run( (int)execmd, 0, 0, 0 );
	if ( i ) {
// Error "Runtime file not found for execution"
	}
